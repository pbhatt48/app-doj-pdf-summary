In comparison to the book value of American Express at the time, which was /dollar.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle million, this seemed like a very large sum.According to Lowenstein’s account, Buﬀett, sensing potential opportu-nity beneath the scandal, carefully began his primary research. He spoke to customers and vendors in Omaha, including restaurants and restau-rant customers, to see if their using habits had changed. He also went to banks and travel agencies, and he even spoke to competitors. Everywhere he went, the conclusion he drew was that the use of American Express travelers cheques and credit cards seemed to be steady despite the scan-dal.

He also concluded that the company was unlikely to go insolvent./three.oldstyleIt is important to look at how an investor may have pictured Ameri-can Express at the time. (See tables /four.oldstyle./one.oldstyle through /four.oldstyle./three.oldstyle for a reproduction of several key pages of the /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle American Express annual report, including the consolidated /f_inancial statements./four.oldstyle) As we can see, in the section titled  the Ten Year Financial Summary, on pages four and /f_ive of the report, American Express publishes a full ten-year history of its income /f_inancials. We notice immediately how strong a business American Express was in the decade preceding /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle.From /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/four.oldstyle to /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle, American Express’s revenues grew from /dollar.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle million to /dollar.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle million. Even more impressive, in no single year during this period did revenues decline from the previous year. /T_he picture for income per share and total book value of the company mirrored that of the revenues; income per share grew from /dollar.oldstyle/one.oldstyle./zero.oldstyle/five.oldstyle to /dollar.oldstyle/two.oldstyle./five.oldstyle/two.oldstyle, and book value increased from /dollar.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle million to /dollar.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle million. Hence on a per annum (p.a.) compounded basis, revenues increased /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle percent p.a., and net earnings increased /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle percent p.a. in the previous nine years.During the year ending December /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle, /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle, American Express deliv-ered net earnings of exactly /dollar.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle./two.oldstyle million (/dollar.oldstyle/two.oldstyle./five.oldstyle/two.oldstyle per share for each of the /four.oldstyle./four.oldstyle/six.oldstyle million shares outstanding) on revenues of /dollar.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle./four.oldstyle million. /T_he pro/f_it before tax (it reported “income before United States and foreign income taxes”) was at /dollar.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle./zero.oldstyle million. With a simple calculation, this translates to an operating margin of about /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle percent and a net pro/f_it margin of about /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle percent, both metrics, suggesting nice pro/f_itability.At /f_irst glance, based on just the /f_inancial numbers, American Express looked like it was running well on all cylinders and had been doing so for quite some time. To really understand a business, however, and to deter-mine whether it is truly a quality business, one must look at more than just /f_inancials. To understand American Express’s business and how it delivered such good /f_inancial results year a/f_ter year, it is important to analyze the operating segments of the company and the competitive environment in which these sub-businesses were operating.In its /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle annual report, American Express discusses its operating segments in a fair level of detail. In total, the report details ten separate businesses. Unfortunately, American Express at the time did not break down the size and margins of each business areas. Still, from the order and depth of the discussion, one can clearly infer which businesses are the core ', metadata={'source': '/content/wb-axp1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='1964: AMERICAN EXPRESS\\u2003/three.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstylebusinesses, and which the secondary businesses. From largest to smallest in scale, the businesses included travelers cheques, money orders, utility bills, travel, credit cards, commercial banking, foreign remittances, freight, Wells Fargo, Hertz, and warehousing.Before I discuss the workings of the major businesses, it should be noted that with ten separate operating segments, American Express was not a simple business in the traditional sense of one business involved in  one clear activity. Nevertheless, if we anlayze each business individually, we can be reassured that an inquisitive investor should understand both busi-nesses because they are based on business models and people rather than complex technology.The largest business, which is also discussed first in the report, was the travelers cheque business. American Express sold paper checks that customers who are to travel abroad could purchase at numerous locations before departure, and which would subsequently be accepted at both venues and banks abroad. These venues and banks would then exchange these checks for foreign currency. American Express col-lected cash and a small fee from customers, while in turn providing them with a network of international banks and venues where their finances would be accepted without question. To encourage more international merchants to accept this product, American Express paid a small commission to the merchants for accepting their travel-ers cheques.At the time, the main alternative to American Express travelers cheques was a letter of credit from a bank. A customer, the same inter-national traveler for example, would go to a bank and, using a combina-tion of deposits, collateral, or previous relationship, would ask the bank to issue a letter of credit. /T_he customer would then present this letter of credit to a foreign bank, which would either provide the customer with foreign currency or otherwise enable the customer to make payments while abroad./T_he travelers cheque has several key advantages over the letter of credit. First, while travelers cheques were very simple to purchase at any American Express aﬃliate, the process of getting a letter of credit depended on the spe-ci/f_ic issuing bank and usually involved signi/f_icant paperwork and took sev-eral days. Because it was less complex, American Express’s solution usually also entailed fewer transaction costs. Compared to cash, travelers cheques could be easily replaced when stolen and hence oﬀered an additional protec-tion for travelers.', metadata={'source': '/content/wb-axp1.pdf', 'page': 2})]"
